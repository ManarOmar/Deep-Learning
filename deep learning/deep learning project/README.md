# Image Classifier Project

## Description

Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

This project is an image classifier for the the flowers dataset with 102 different types of flowers, 

In the first part of the project, I worked through a Jupyter notebook to implement an image classifier with PyTorch. I used a pretrained model, and I achieved an accuracy 89.9% on the test data set.

In the Second Part of the project, I converted the first part into an application that others can use, it is a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line.  

## Dependancies

This image classifier was built using **Pytorch** , PyTorch is an open source library for Python easily used to train neural networks.
PyTorch was released in early 2017 and has been making a pretty big impact in the deep learning community. It's developed by the Facebook AI Research team, but is being adopted by teams everywhere in industry and academia. In my experience, it's the best framework for learning deep learning and just a delight to work with in general.
